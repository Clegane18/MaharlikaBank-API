Adding transaction history to your bank app involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement this feature in your existing architecture:

1. **Database Table**: Create a new database table to store transaction records. This table should have columns to store information such as transaction ID, customer ID, transaction type (deposit, withdrawal, etc.), transaction amount, timestamp, and any other relevant details.

2. **Model**: Create a Sequelize model for the transaction history table. This model will define the structure of the transaction records and how they relate to customer accounts.
(npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --config src/config/config.json --migrations-path src/database/migrations
)
3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Create new API endpoints to record and retrieve transaction history. You can have endpoints like `/transactions` to create a new transaction record and `/transactions/{customerId}` to retrieve transaction history for a specific customer.
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access their transaction history.

4. **Controller**: In your controller, create functions to handle the new endpoints. For example, you might have a `createTransaction` function to record a new transaction and a `getTransactionHistory` function to retrieve transaction history for a customer.

5. **Service Layer**: Implement the business logic for recording transactions and retrieving transaction history in your service layer. Here are some steps you can follow:
   - When a user makes a deposit or withdrawal, create a new transaction record in the database.
   - When retrieving transaction history, query the database for transactions associated with the customer's ID.
   - You can also implement pagination for the transaction history to limit the number of records returned in a single request.

6. **Middleware and Authentication**: Ensure that the API endpoints for transaction history are protected with authentication and authorization. Only the customer whose transaction history is being requested should be able to access it.

7. **Frontend Integration**: Update your frontend to include a section where users can view their transaction history. You can display this information as a list or a table with relevant details.

8. **Testing**: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of your new transaction history endpoints and ensure that they work as expected.

9. **Documentation**: Update your API documentation to include information about the new transaction history endpoints so that other developers (or yourself) can easily understand how to use them.

10. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for cases where transactions cannot be recorded or transaction history cannot be retrieved.

Once you've completed these steps, your bank app will have a transaction history feature that allows users to track their financial activities. Users can view their deposits, withdrawals, and other transactions, which adds transparency and accountability to your application.
